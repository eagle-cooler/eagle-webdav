# Product Context - Eagle WebDAV Plugin

## Problem Statement
Eagle users need to access their organized media libraries from external applications and devices that support WebDAV protocol. Currently, Eagle's content is locked within the application, making it difficult to:
- Access files from mobile devices
- Use Eagle content in other creative applications
- Share organized content through standard file protocols
- Integrate Eagle libraries with cloud storage tools that support WebDAV

## Solution Approach
Create a background plugin that transforms Eagle into a WebDAV server, making the entire library accessible through the industry-standard WebDAV protocol.
