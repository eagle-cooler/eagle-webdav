# Active Context - Eagle WebDAV Plugin

## Current Focus
Successfully resolved all major folder navigation issues in the WebDAV implementation. The system now provides clean, flat folder browsing with proper file access. Focus moving to implementing the allItems container for complete flat browsing experience.

## Recent Critical Changes - RESOLVED

### Ghost Folder Resolution (Just Completed) ‚úÖ
**Final Issue**: WebDAV client showing duplicate folder entries (ghost folders) within themselves
**Root Cause**: WebDAV client misinterpreting current directory XML entry as a child folder
**Solution**: Modified XML generation to exclude current directory entry for specific folder listings
**Result**: Clean folder browsing showing only actual files, no more circular references

### Complete Folder Navigation Resolution ‚úÖ
**Issues Resolved**:
1. **URL Decoding**: Fixed folder names with spaces ("prior%202025" ‚Üí "prior 2025")
2. **Circular References**: Eliminated self-referencing folder structures
3. **Empty Folders**: Fixed Eagle API item retrieval for folder contents  
4. **Ghost Folders**: Resolved WebDAV client XML interpretation issues

**Technical Fixes Applied**:
```typescript
// URL decoding for folder names
const folderName = decodeURIComponent(pathname.substring(9).replace(/\/$/, ''));

// Proper file item formatting
const fileItem = {
  id: item.id,
  name: item.name,
  size: item.size || 0, // Ensure size is always present
  mimeType: getMimeType(item.ext),
  // Explicitly NOT including children property
};

// Conditional XML directory entry
const shouldIncludeCurrentDirectory = pathname === '/' || pathname === '/folders' || isDepthZero;
```

### Flattened Folder Structure ‚úÖ
**User Requirement**: 
- All Eagle folders displayed at same level under "/folders"
- Regardless of Eagle's internal hierarchy
- Clean navigation: Root ‚Üí "Folders" ‚Üí All folders ‚Üí Files

**Implementation**:
- **Recursive Collection**: Traverse entire Eagle folder hierarchy
- **Flat Presentation**: All folders accessible at `/folders/[name]`
- **File Access**: Direct file serving via `/files/[id]`
**User Requirement Clarification**: 
- User wants to see ALL Eagle folders in a flat list under "/folders"
- Regardless of parent-child relationships in Eagle's hierarchy
- Simple structure: Root ‚Üí "Folders" ‚Üí All folders at same level

**Problem with Previous Approach**: 
- Was only showing root-level folders from `eagle.folder.getAll()`
- Eagle has nested folder hierarchies (parent/child relationships)
- Nested folders were hidden and not accessible via WebDAV

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Recursive Folder Collection**: Traverse entire Eagle folder hierarchy
- **Flatten Structure**: Collect ALL folders (root + nested) into single array
- **Flat Navigation**: Present all folders at same level under `/folders/`

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// New recursive collection function
function collectAllFolders(folderList: any[]) {
  for (const folder of folderList) {
    allFolders.push(folder);
    // Recursively collect nested folders too
    if (folder.children && Array.isArray(folder.children)) {
      collectAllFolders(folder.children);
    }
  }
}
```

**Updated Search Function**:
- `getFolderByName()` now searches through ALL folders (including nested)
- Recursive search ensures any folder can be found by name
- Supports folders that were previously hidden in Eagle's hierarchy

**Final WebDAV Structure**:
```
/                          ‚Üí Shows "Folders" container
/folders/                  ‚Üí Shows ALL Eagle folders (flattened)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RootFolder1/         ‚Üí Root level folder  
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RootFolder2/         ‚Üí Root level folder
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NestedFolderA/       ‚Üí Previously nested folder (now flat)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NestedFolderB/       ‚Üí Previously nested folder (now flat)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AnyOtherFolder/      ‚Üí Any folder from Eagle hierarchy
/folders/FolderName/       ‚Üí Contents of any specific folder
/files/{id}                ‚Üí Individual files
```

### Previous Display Name Resolution
**Problem**: WebDAV clients were showing cryptic folder IDs (like "MFKAJCAXA587I") instead of readable names, and files were missing their extensions.
**Solution**: Fixed XML generation to use `item.name` for folders and `item.name + item.ext` for files
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed and integrated into refactored modules

### Memory Bank Initialization (In Progress)
Creating comprehensive project documentation system for context preservation across sessions.

**Files Created**:
- ‚úÖ `projectbrief.md` - Core project requirements
- ‚úÖ `productContext.md` - User problems and solutions  
- ‚úÖ `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- ‚úÖ `techContext.md` - Technology stack and constraints
- üîÑ `activeContext.md` - This file (current status)
- ‚è≥ `progress.md` - Remaining work and status

## Architecture Decisions Made

### HTTP Server Implementation
**Decision**: Use Node.js built-in `http` module instead of Express.js
**Rationale**: Express.js not available in Eagle's plugin environment
**Impact**: More verbose but fully compatible implementation

### Authentication Strategy  
**Decision**: Basic HTTP authentication with hostname/UUID
**Rationale**: Simple, secure for localhost, auto-generated credentials
**Implementation**: WWW-Authenticate challenge-response pattern

### WebDAV Protocol Compliance
**Decision**: Full WebDAV implementation with proper XML responses
**Rationale**: Maximum client compatibility (Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, WebDAV apps)
**Key Methods**: PROPFIND, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS with RFC-compliant XML

## Current Code State

### Refactored WebDAV Architecture (`src/services/webdav/`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete modular structure
- **Core Server** (`webdav.ts`): Clean server logic with modular imports
- **XML Generation** (`xml.ts`): WebDAV protocol XML responses
- **File Handler** (`fileHandler.ts`): File serving and MIME type detection
- **Eagle Parser** (`eagleParser.ts`): Eagle API integration and metadata parsing
- **Types** (`types.ts`): Shared TypeScript interfaces
- **Index** (`index.ts`): Clean module exports and re-exports

### Background Service (`src/services/background.ts`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and unchanged

- **Styling**: ‚úÖ TailwindCSS with DaisyUI components

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Test Folder Navigation (Priority 1)
- Test the WebDAV server with a WebDAV client (AirExplorer, Windows Explorer)
- Verify root shows "Folders" container
- Verify clicking into "Folders" shows all Eagle folders with proper names
- Verify clicking into individual Eagle folders shows contents with proper folder name in title
- Confirm folder names no longer change to IDs during navigation

### 2. Validate Complete Functionality (Priority 2)
- Test file downloading from folders
- Verify authentication still works properly
- Check that all existing functionality remains intact
- Validate the new hierarchical structure works as expected

### 3. User Testing and Deployment (Priority 3)
- Package the updated plugin for user testing
- Document the new folder structure for users
- Monitor for any additional navigation issues

## Key Patterns and Preferences

### Error Handling Philosophy
- Graceful degradation for Eagle API failures
- Comprehensive logging without exposing sensitive paths
- User-friendly error messages in UI

### Code Organization  
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage across all modules
- **Import/Export**: Proper module boundaries with index file for clean exports
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a focused, well-defined purpose

### Refactoring Benefits Achieved
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to navigate and modify
- **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Components can be imported and used independently
- **Readability**: Clear separation of WebDAV protocol, file handling, and Eagle integration

## Critical Learnings

### Eagle Plugin Environment
- **Module Constraints**: Only Node.js built-ins available
- **API Surface**: Rich but specific integration patterns required
- **Service Mode**: Background plugins have different lifecycle management

### WebDAV Client Expectations
- **Authentication**: Must implement proper challenge-response
- **XML Format**: Strict compliance required for compatibility
- **File Metadata**: Display names and extensions critical for UX

### Development Workflow
- **Build Process**: Vite works well for Eagle plugin development
- **Debugging**: Eagle Developer Tools provide good debugging experience
- **Testing**: WebDAV clients provide immediate feedback on protocol compliance

## Current Working State
The plugin now provides a flattened folder browsing experience where ALL Eagle folders (regardless of their hierarchy in Eagle) are presented at the same level under the "Folders" container. This creates a simple, flat navigation structure that makes all folders easily accessible through WebDAV clients. Build successful and ready for testing with AirExplorer.
